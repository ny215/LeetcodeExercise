#Topological sorting with DFS O(n)

Topological sorting:
for each node:
	if not marked:
		if(dfs(node) == CYCLE) return CYCLE
return OK

dfs(node):
	if node is marked as visited: return OK
	if node is marked as visiting: return CYCLE
	mark node as visiting
	for each new_node in node.neighbors:
		if dfs(new_node) == CYCLE: return CYCLE
	mark as visited
	#add node to the head of ordered_list
	return OK
